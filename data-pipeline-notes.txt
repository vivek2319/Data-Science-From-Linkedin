Rule of thumb 👍 for choosing big data pipeline technologies:

Data in motion 😎:
Ask yourself, are you IO bound or CPU bound?

IO bound usually means that you are doing a lot of enrichments using some microservices or db lookups. In this case, Spark is not your friend. You should go with something like Akka Streams.

If you are CPU bound, (as in doing some meaningful processing) go with Apache Spark. Spark is really powerful at splitting your data and utilizing your cores.

If you have a mix, go with Spark and mix it with RxJava on Schedulers.io().

Batch 😴:
Use Apache Spark on Yarn. Ok, if you really need to quickly run SQL on a large amount of data, use Presto.

Temporary place to put your data:
Apache Kafka

Workflow:
Use AirFlow.

If you enjoy pain and willing to spend a lot of money, use Cassandra. 

Everything else is either looking for trouble or solving a very specific case.
