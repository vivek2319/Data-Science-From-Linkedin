Going into data science and analytics? Degree program, bootcamp, self-study? There are tons of options! They can also be overwhelming. Here are my thoughts on how to weigh your options:

Universities:

1. + Structured environment.
2. + Regular cadence of assignments/projects.
3. + Strong connections to local businesses.
4. + Strength of network
5. - Often requires most time out of workforce
6. - Often highest cost options
7. + Workforce placement programs often extremely strong

Bootcamps:

1. + Structured environment.
2. + Regular cadence of assignments/projects.
3. + Less time out of the workforce (often 12 weeks)
4. +/- Connections to local businesses are variable (sometimes good, sometimes not)
5. +/- Few bootcamps are good at helping you network, mostly because of the short time in which you are there.
6. +/- Cost on per hour basis of instruction is low compared to universities.
7. +/- Workforce placement programs vary quite a bit. Requires research.

Self-study:

1. + Cost is awesome! Often quite cheap to take required courses.
2. - Network building is all up to you.
3. - Connections with businesses can be much harder to develop.
4. + Can be fit into most any schedule, even while working full time.
5. - No assistance in workforce placement.

What do you think? Questions?
