I often get asked - what's the best certification to become a data scientist?

👉 My answer is always the same: none.

The reality is that the certifications don't matter for data science.

This isn't accounting. We aren't using the same techniques over and over again to solve well-defined problems.

The problem are challenging, the data is messy, and techniques used are numerous.

So if you've been wondering which certification you should get, save yourself some mental energy and stop thinking about it - they don't matter.

👉 Instead, grab a dataset and start playing with it.

Start applying what you know and trying to solve interesting problems.

Turn these explorations and learning experiences into portfolio projects and leverage them in your job search.

This will help you a lot more than stack your resume with certifications.

👉 Here are a few places to grab datasets to get you started:
