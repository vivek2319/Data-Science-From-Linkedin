How to get started with Microsoft Excel for Data Science? 

This is a very requested post, and not a very common from me. I personally don't use Excel to do any data science. Don't get me wrong, is an amazing tool, and not that expensive for what it does and its connection to the Office environment. 

Excel has been around for 31 years (yep since 1987), and it has been a very important tool in the enterprise and academic world. If you are familiar with tools in Python and R that have DataFrames, then you can use Excel, you'll find is very easy and powerful for simple tasks.

It has advance functionalities too like calculations, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming in VBA. 

I still think you should be learning tools closer to Python and R, but if you love Excel here is a list of courses that will allow you to use it as a Data Science tool:
