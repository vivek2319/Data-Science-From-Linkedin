How to get started with Statistics for Data Science?

Hello everyone! I'm back with the getting started for data science series :). Now with a really important topic: Statistics

We've been talking about the importance for several areas of knowledge for Data Science, but I think one of the pillars of the area are the Statistical Sciences.

Why Statistics?

- It is, with Calculus and Algebra, the core of every Machine and Deep Learning we use for Data Science.
- We need to evaluate and validate our models, make predictions, calculate probabilities and infer possible scenarios, and all of that is possible through Statistics.
- The art of plotting statistical distributions, trends, time series, and make stunning visualizations for the business meetings you'll have to explain your results needs a good statistical base.

There are more reasons but let's see how you can get started with this great topic:
