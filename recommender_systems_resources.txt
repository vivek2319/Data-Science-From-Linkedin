My Top 7 Algorithms to Know for Building Recommender Systems

Want to learn how to build awesome rec systems? Start here:

1. Item-based collaborative filtering - https://lnkd.in/gNkK9HP
2. Non-negative matrix factorization - https://lnkd.in/giUXS-E
3. Contenting-based filtering - https://lnkd.in/gFvacKs
4. kNN - https://lnkd.in/gUvEqsR
5. Knowledge-based rec systems - https://lnkd.in/gW5muUV
6. Clustering - https://lnkd.in/gdTkW3K
7. Vector similarity measures: Pearson, Jaccard, cosine - https://lnkd.in/gn55WhP - https://lnkd.in/g5iuCPF - https://lnkd.in/gEMj9hp

Bonus 1: Bayesian networks - https://lnkd.in/gKF2Y87
Bonus 2: Hidden Markov models - https://lnkd.in/gzzNGtj

Start by getting familiar with collaborative filtering at a high level - https://lnkd.in/gtE5HRB

Then grab a dataset:

* Last.fm - https://lnkd.in/gUr-8U6
* MovieLens - https://lnkd.in/gNv4FYN
* Others - https://lnkd.in/gnqu7XR

Next, start exploring the algorithms and experimenting with them on your data.

Lastly, remember to keep it simple!

Get familiar with these 7 concepts and you'll be ready to take on almost any recommendation problem in no time.
