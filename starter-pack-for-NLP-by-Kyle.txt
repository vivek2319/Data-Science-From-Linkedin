My Top 9 Concepts to Know for NLP

Interested in NLP? Get familiar with these 9 algorithms before you get started:

	1. tf-idf - https://lnkd.in/ghfqfm7
	2. N-grams - https://lnkd.in/gCDChaT
	3. Stemming - https://lnkd.in/gwHuE68
	4. Lemmatisation - https://lnkd.in/gRU8Q5m
	5. Cosine similarity - https://lnkd.in/gEMj9hp
	6. Bag-of-words - https://lnkd.in/gzv7NDX
	7. Word2vec - https://lnkd.in/gV2yEsn
	8. LDA - https://lnkd.in/gF2qcnJ
	9. Edit distance - https://lnkd.in/gy3wU5H

Bonus: LSTM - https://lnkd.in/gu9H9vM

Get familiar with these concepts at a high level, and then grab a dataset and start playing around. You'll learn a lot more by implementing these ideas with real data than just reading and studying forever.

Here are two great sources to grab free text datasets:

👉 https://lnkd.in/gFR9njn

Remember to start simple and then iteratively build and test from there (not every model needs to be a neural network!).

👉 Get familiar with these 9 concepts and and you'll be ready to conquer challenging NLP problems in no time.
